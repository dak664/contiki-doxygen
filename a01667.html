<p>The Modular Sensor Board (MSB430) was developed by FU-Berlin and was added as a platform in Contiki in the spring of 2007. </p>
<p>In its basic form, this board consists of a Texas Instruments MSP430f1612 processor, a Chipcon CC1020 radio chip, an MMA7260Q accelerometer, and a Sensirion SHT11 temperature and humidity sensor. The MSB also has an SD device, which makes it suitable for storage-centric sensor networks. There are also extended versions of the board that are equipped with a GPRS-modem and a GPS-receiver.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="msb430-programming">
Programming the MSB430</a></h2>
<p>The msb430 port requires an installation of mspgcc (<a href="http://mspgcc.sourceforge.net">http://mspgcc.sourceforge.net</a>) to compile. Once the compilation tools have been installed, you can compile your software and Contiki with three main target types:</p>
<p>&lt;file&gt;.firmware - A system image in ELF format. &lt;file&gt;.ihex - A firmware file converted to the Intel Hex format. &lt;file&gt;.u - Direct upload to a node.</p>
<p>Before compiling your system, you may want to look at the configuration options in platform/msb430/configure-conf.h.</p>
<p>The node is typically programmed by typing</p>
<p>make TARGET=msb430 &lt;program name&gt;=""&gt;.u</p>
<p>Alternatively, a ready .ihex file can be uploaded to the node by running</p>
<p>msp430-jtag -l &lt;parallell port="" identifier&gt;=""&gt; -e -I &lt;ihex file&gt;=""&gt;</p>
<p>Platform-specific example programs are included in platform/msb430/apps and can be compiled and uploaded from platform/msb430. A larger set of examples for Contiki in general are in the examples/ directory.</p>
<p>More information about the MSB430 platform can be found at Scatterweb: <a href="http://www.scatterweb.com/content/products/MSB_en.html">http://www.scatterweb.com/content/products/MSB_en.html</a> </p>
